<h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>



<ul>
        <li>Beef</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Potatoes</li>
        <li>Carrots</li>


</ul>
<br>
<h>Instructions</h3>

        <p>Preheat oven: While prepping everything else preheat the oven to 325° F.
                Prep Beef: Season the beef chunks on all sides with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the flour over and toss the seasoned beef to coat it on all sides.
                Heat Skillet: Heat the olive oil in a large Dutch oven over medium heat.
                 If you don’t have a dutch oven, use an oven-safe skillet/pot that has a cover.
                Partially cook beef: Brown the beef in batches, on all sides, for 3-4 minutes per batch. Don’t worry about cooking the beef all the way through at this stage.
                 Transfer the browned beef to a plate and set aside. </p>

       <h5>Instructions</h5>
       
               <p>Prepare vegetables and ingredients: Set up all the ingredients and get your shredded chicken ready.
                Cook vegetables: Add butter or oil in a large stockpot over medium-high heat. First, add the onions, celery, carrots, bell pepper, garlic and cook until softens, about 5-6 minutes. Then, stir in seasonings, diced tomatoes, tomato paste, and chicken broth and bring to a boil.
                Cook and prep soup: Lower the heat and simmer for about 10-15 minutes, or until veggies are very tender.

                Blend: remove from heat and using a hand blender, blend the soup until smooth and creamy. (This is optional if you don’t want to blend you can skip this step).
                Add beans and chicken: Place the soup back over medium heat and add in beans, corn and shredded cooked chicken. Stir to combine and boil for a couple of minutes, just to heat it all up. </p>

              <h8>Instructions</h8>
              
                      <p>Preheat Oven: We recommend anywhere between 350-400F. For this stuffed chicken recipe we went with 400F.
                        Season the chicken: Place the chicken on a clean chopping board and sprinkle with Italian seasoning, garlic powder, paprika, salt, and pepper.
                        Create a pocket in the chicken: Start cutting each one lengthwise to create the pockets. Be careful not to cut all the way through. Start with the top thick part of the breast as shown in the how-to video down below.
                        Stuff the chicken: Add 3 springs of asparagus and a couple of pieces of sun-dried tomatoes to a mozzarella slice, then roll it to hold them inside. Stuff the chicken breasts with it. Close the pocket with a toothpick.
                        Cook on skillet: Heat oil in a large and cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. Then, add in the chicken and sear it until nicely golden brown, about 3-5 minutes per side.
                        Bake: Finally, bake the chicken for 15-20 minutes, or until it is cooked through and no longer pink on the inside. Enjoy!
